# Eric Xiang's repository for MiniData analysis

This Minidata Analysis is part of the [STAT 545A](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545a/) course at the University of British Columbia. This goal of this analysis is to select a provided dataset and perform exploratory analysis on the data, including viewing the data, plotting the data, and coming up the research question 

**For Minidata Analysis 1 specifically,** I first chose the dataset I am interested and took a look of the heading,class, dimension of the data and decided to go with cancer_sample data. I then performed an qualitative exploratory analysis to assess  if mean radius of the image is realted to the cancer diagnosis result. I also came up my four questions that I would like to explore in the Milestone2.
