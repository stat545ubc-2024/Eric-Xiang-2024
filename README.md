# Eric Xiang's repository for MiniData analysis

This Minidata Analysis is part of the [STAT 545A](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545a/) course at the University of British Columbia. The goal of this analysis is to select a provided dataset and perform exploratory analysis on the data, including viewing the data, plotting the data, and coming up the research question

**For Minidata Analysis 1 (MDA1) specifically,** I first chose the datasets I am interested and took a look of the overall dataset structure with glimpse,class, dimension, summary of the data. I also utilized dplyr to do a quick exploration of each chosen datasets. I then decided to go with *cancer_sample* data. I performed a qualitative exploratory analysis to assess if the biopsy radius mean is related to the cancer diagnosis result. I also came up my four questions that I would like to explore in the Milestone 2.

**For MInidata Analysis 2 (MDA2) Specifically** ,I qualitatively explored *cancer_sample* data to answer the four questions I proposed in the MDA1 by summarizing statistics and plotting graphs. I also examined the tidiness of the data and generated the tidy data to specifically address my questions I also ran a model testing the variable correlation and predictions. Lastly, I exported the summary table and model objects as CSV and binary files.
